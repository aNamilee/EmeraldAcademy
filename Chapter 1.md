# Day 1

**Q1: Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.**

A blockchain is a distributed database, usually open so users are able to store and interact with the data.

**Q2: Explain what a Smart Contract is.**

A smart contract is code that developers build to specify functionality that users can interact with on the blockchain.

**Q3: Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.**

A script is used to view data on the blockchain and does not change it, free to use. A transaction does change the data on the blockchain and varies in cost.


# Day 2

**Q1: What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?**

1. Safety and Security - strong type system
2. Clarity - easy to read
3. Approachability - familiar to other programming language, ease of transition or onboarding
4. Developer Experience - able to debug in easy manner
5. Resource Oriented Programming - most important, core of Cadence

**Q2: In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?**

1. Safety and Security - helps prevent malicious attacks
2. Clarity - makes auditing and reviewing more efficient
3. Approachability - enables developers to create programs quickly and effectively
4. Developer Experience - less troubleshooting, more programming?
5. Resource Oriented Programming - will have a better understanding apparently, *at some point* XD
